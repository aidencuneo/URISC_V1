Stack items are used as function arguments in the order that they are taken
from the top of the stack

Uppercase variables A, B, C, etc. are function return values

The first item in the stack can be used to tell a particular function how many
arguments it will be receiving from the stack, if that function can receive an
undefined amount

Functions are stylised based on Quokka functions for readability, for example:
fun name argmin argmax : retcount
